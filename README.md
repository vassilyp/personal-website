# personal-website
This is for my personal website, which I am writing in Go and HTML (using HTMX)

I intend for this website to become my custom homepage, where I can put up
projects, devlogs/blogs, and games as I please :)

Note to self:
Upon update, login to the server, pull changes, and restart with `sudo service goweb restart`
